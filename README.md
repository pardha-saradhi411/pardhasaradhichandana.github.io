# Neon Tech Glow — Portfolio (Final)

This is the final Neon Tech Glow portfolio for Pardha Saradhi Chandana.

**How to edit content (quick):**
- Open `data.js` and change values in FACTS, SKILLS, EXPERIENCE, EDUCATION, PROJECTS, CERTIFICATIONS, CONTACT.
- Add project images to `assets/projects/` and set `image` property in the PROJECTS array (filename only).
- Add certificate images to `assets/certifications/` similarly.

**Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
1. Create a new public repository named `pardhasaradhichandana.github.io`.
2. Upload all files from this folder to the repo root.
3. On GitHub: Settings → Pages → Source → choose `main` branch (root). Save.
4. Wait a minute; site available at https://pardhasaradhichandana.github.io

**Edit live later:**
- Use GitHub web editor to edit `data.js` directly and commit; the live site updates after commit.
